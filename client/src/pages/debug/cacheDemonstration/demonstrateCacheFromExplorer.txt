The cache is deeply embedded into the expected operation of Apollo, so much so that
queries sent from the explorer debug tool will update content on the page as they utilize
the same cache. 

Use the following mutation to demonstrate setting the demonstration's description.



mutation ACompletelySeparateMutation($updateDemonstrationId: ID!, $input: UpdateDemonstrationInput!) {
  updateDemonstration(id: $updateDemonstrationId, input: $input) {
    id
    description
  }
}
